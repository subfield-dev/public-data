# Relational Academia (RA) Dataset

## Overview

The Relational Academia (RA) dataset is the most comprehensive longitudinal dataset ever compiled on the careers of full-time social science faculty at Canada’s U15 research-intensive universities. Developed in response to the lack of systematic data about hiring outcomes/practices in Canadian academia, this dataset helps critically assess the legacy of the Canadianization Movement and contemporary patterns of academic hiring.

RA documents faculty careers from **1977 to 2018**, offering a four-decade view of institutional hiring, faculty mobility, and the distribution of doctoral training across Canadian and international universities.

## Data Release

The RA dataset will be made publicly available in **Summer 2025**. The release will include:
- Cleaned CSV files  
- A data dictionary and codebook  
- Basic summary statistics and visualizations  
- Sample scripts for longitudinal and network analysis

Stay tuned for updates through this repository, or contact [f.lachapelle@proton.me](mailto:f.lachapelle@proton.me) with questions or to get on the release notification list.

## Data Collection

Data was collected using a combination of archival research and online research. At each 10-year interval (**1977–78**, **1987–88**, **1997–98**, **2007–08**, and **2017–18**), we identified full-time faculty members in five social science disciplines across Canada’s U15 universities.

### Sources & Methods

- Systematic review of **academic calendars**, **archived faculty directories**, and **departmental listings** in physical, microfiche, and digital formats  
- Manual data collection for cases with missing educational information using the **Internet Archive (Wayback Machine)**, **ProQuest dissertations**, **university press releases**, and publicly available **CVs** and **faculty bios**

### Collected Variables

Each faculty record includes:
- Academic rank (assistant, associate, full professor)
- Degree history (bachelor's, master's, PhD — including institution names)
- Disciplinary affiliation
- Employer institution and collection year

### Inclusion Criteria
