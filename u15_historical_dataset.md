# Relational Academia (RA) Dataset

## Overview

The Relational Academia (RA) dataset is the most comprehensive longitudinal dataset ever compiled on the careers of full-time social science faculty at Canada’s U15 research-intensive universities. Developed in response to the lack of systematic data about hiring outcomes/practices in Canadian academia, this dataset helps critically assess the legacy of the Canadianization Movement and contemporary patterns of academic hiring.

RA documents faculty careers from **1977 to 2018**, offering a four-decade view of institutional hiring, faculty mobility, and the distribution of doctoral training across Canadian and international universities.
